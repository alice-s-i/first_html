                <h3>Disclaimer</h3>
                <p>This is a tough one. I'm quite scared to post any pasta recipes since I know
                    that none of the things I write are gonna be considered authentic enough for italians. 
                    So let me say  this one very important disclaimer: I'm not claiming it to be the initial
                    authentic recipe that is 100% Italian. It is probably not. This is just something I cook
                    at home and my friends and family seem to like it so I'm gonna be making it either way.
                    If you are Italian ‚Äì Ciao, come stai? sono ossessionato dall'Italia ma ho dimenticato tutto
                    il mio italiano che ho imparato negli anni. Per favore portami del formaggio (parmigiano,
                    pecorino o anche stracciatella) e ti presenter√≤ su questo sito. Grazieüíöü§ç‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
				<h3>Ingredients</h3>

                    just take as much as you think you‚Äôll need for your sauce - did you really think i‚Äôd tell you everything with precise measurements???

				<h3>How to Make It:</h3>
				<p>start by chopping the onion and peeling the garlic.<b style="color: rgb(116, 116, 116)">
                    in my experience I found that chopping the garlic is not that crucial, throwing a couple of whole garlic cloves
                    works just fine, you get the taste and smell you need without your hands smelling
                    like garlic for the next two days.</b> in a large pan, heat the olive oil with butter
                    <b style="color: rgb(116, 116, 116)">(i‚Äôm obsessed with this combo for no reason)</b> over medium heat. add your onions and
                    garlic. meanwhile, bring the pot of salted water to a boil. when onions are softened,
                    add your tomatoes (if you use cherry tomatoes or regular ones, don‚Äôt forget to chop
                    them a bit beforehand). while the sauce is cooking, add pasta to the hot salted
                    water and cook it according to the instructions on the package until al dente. add
                    fresh green basil along with all the spices to the tomato sauce and stir. you can
                    also add a bit of pasta water to make the sauce less thick. add the cooked pasta
                    to the sauce and mix well. leave it on the stove for a few minutes. serve it with 
                    insane amount of grated cheese</p>

                <h3>More options:</h3>
                <p> <b style="font-weight: bold;">üçãlemon tomato pasta</b>
                    <br> additional:
                    <br> lemon
                    <br> cilantro
                    <br>
                    <br> add lemon zest and lemon juice when cooking the sauce and don‚Äôt forget chopped cilantro
                    when the sauce is almost cooked!!! it is insanely good with white wine. trust me
                    <br>
                    <br> üå±pesto tomato pasta
                    <br> additional:
                    <br> pesto 
                    <br> more basil
                    <br>
                    <br>just add pesto right before you add tomatoes to the saucepan. yep. it‚Äôs that simple. 
                    top it with basil when served
